5 weeks in, and I have experienced the first significant cross-browser challenge. Chrome for some reason behaves differently to both firefox and safari. 

### Situation, Task, Action, Result

I have found a significant bug in chrome that causes the SVG to fail specifically in that browser. In order to resolve this issue, I had to post it on tech forums asking for any advice, and reported the issues to chrome bug tracker. Unfortunately there does not seem to be an easy solution to it. After discussions with the supervisor, I implemented a solution in chrome that will render a different thing depending on the browser in question.
