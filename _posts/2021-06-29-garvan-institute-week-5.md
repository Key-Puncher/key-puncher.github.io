It's past the mid-point mark now.

### Working From Home
Because of the new restrictions in Sydney, I have had to continue with my placement at home. Luckily, the placement involves mostly work that can be done remotely. I've taken my work laptop home, as well as the necessary adaptors. I've set up a larger monitor as well so I have a second display that helps with my work. I'm also looking into getting headphones shipped so I can have better audio for meetings. I have been sent several manuscripts by my supervisor, which I have been working through. My supervisor and I have a daily meeting at 2pm to catch up, which allows me to report my progress and get feedback.

Working at home has significant challenges: the set-up of my working environment and the feedback I can recieve being major ones currently. Though I do save a little bit of time in the commute, and safety in this current situation is the most important thing.

### Situation, Task, Action, Result

It was daunting at first to try to interperate the large amount of code and add to it. I had to break down the task into much smaller, workable sections. I planned out my approach, communicating with my supervisor about key priorities. Learning the JavaScript format and how to use D3 and Vue were also part of the challenge. I had never used these libraries before, but I have seen JavaScript and I have learnt about web-development in university. Learning the new language was just a matter of reading some of the documentation on the libraries, as well as reading the existing code. Because the coverage map was already designed, that aspect helped greatly as I already knew what I wanted the visual product to look like. Creating simple shapes in D3 was easy, but the create the more complex shape of the arrows, I had to combine the knowledge of coding and web-design to put multiple shapes together. I subsequently was able to implement and deliver the first aspects of the project, interactive coverage arrows for the proteome.
