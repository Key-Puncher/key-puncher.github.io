It's past the mid-point mark now.

### Working From Home
Because of the new restrictions in Sydney, I have had to continue with my placement at home. Luckily, the placement involves mostly work that can be done remotely. I have been sent several manuscripts, which I have been working through. My supervisor and I have a daily meeting at 2pm to catch up, which allows me to report my progress and get feedback.

Working at home has significant challenges. The set-up of my working environment and the feedback I can recieve. Though I do save a little bit of time in the commute.

### Situation, Task, Action, Result

It was daunting at first to try to interperate the large amount of code and add to it. I had to break down the task into much smaller, workable sections. I planned out my approach, communicating with my supervisor about key priorities. I subsequently was able to implement and deliver the first aspects of the project, interactive coverage arrows for the proteome.
