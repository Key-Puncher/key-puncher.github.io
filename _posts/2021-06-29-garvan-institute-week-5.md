title: Garvan Institute Week 5

It's past the mid-point mark of my placement. I am now working from home, which presents new challenges to the internship. I have been sent several manuscripts by my supervisor, which I have been working through. My supervisor and I have a daily meeting at 2pm to catch up, which allows me to report my progress and get feedback. Working at home has significant challenges: the set-up of my working environment and the feedback I can recieve being major ones currently. Though I do save a little bit of time in the commute, and safety in this current situation is the most important thing.

### Situation, Task, Action, Result
Because of the new restrictions in Sydney, I have had to continue with my placement at home. Luckily, the placement involves mostly work that can be done remotely. I've taken my work laptop home, as well as the necessary adaptors. I've set up a larger monitor as well so I have a second display that helps with my work. I'm also looking into getting headphones shipped so I can have better audio for meetings. Doing all of this preparation and set-up work now means that I will have a easier time in the future, and continue to deliver the work on time with minimal disruptions because of the covid-19 outbreak in Sydney.
