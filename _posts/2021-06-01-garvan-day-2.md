title: Garvan Institute Day 2
---

### Early Experience
During the first day at Garvan, I was given a desk and introduced to my team. I had discussed with my supervisor the project before starting the internship here, and on my second day I had the chance to start to look into the code here. 

Like many other code bases where multiple people have contributed to it, it was a challenge getting oriented in it. I am a little worried about figuring it out, and delivering a good result in time. However, I believe I must simply take some time to understand the unfamiliar code.

I just tried several different methods, and looked at how the code responded. My collegues were very helpful when I ran into problems. I was able to ask for help and get them resolved quickly, or just being directed to the right direction for my investigation.

### Early Achievements 
I've found that the early days are very challenging, just getting my feet wet in the code base. It's large and unfamiliar, and hard to find anything. However, I was able to ask my collegues, who have the knowledge of the codebase and similar areas of code that already exist, that could help me get on the right track. They were able to point me to areas in the code where similar problems had been experienced in the past. This existing code worked great as a reference which allowed me to progress in my task, as they used some methods that I had not known about beforehand to solve the issues I encountered.
