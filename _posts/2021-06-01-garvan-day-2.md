### Garvan Day 2

For my second day at Garvan, I had the chance to really dig into the project here. Like many other code bases where multiple people have contributed to it, it was a challenge getting oriented in it. I was a little worried about figuring it out, but I trust that I must simply take some time to understand the unfamiliar code.

I just tried several different methods, and looked at how the code responded. My collegues were very helpful when I ran into problems. I was able to ask for help and get them resolved quickly, or just being directed to the right direction for my investigation.

Date: 1 June. Hours: 7. Recieved my access badge, and started to look into the code for the project.
