title: Garvan Institute Day 2
---

### Starting the Placement
During the first day at Garvan, I was given a desk and introduced to my team. The team is fairly small, with only 3 people based in the Australia office. I had discussed with my supervisor the project before starting the internship here. They had manually created a chart of the covid-19 coverage map. However, they would like to automate this process so that the coverage map can be generated automatically for covid and its related viruses, including SARS and MERS. 

This presents some significant challenges, because of the amount of data that needs to be processed and displayed in different ways, and also some inconsistencies in the way that bioinformatics data is stored.

On my second day I had the chance to start to look into the code. Like many other code bases where multiple people have contributed to it, it was a challenge getting oriented in it. I am a little worried about figuring it out, and delivering a good result in time. However, I believe I must simply take some time to understand the unfamiliar code.

I just tried several different methods, creating a new file and playing around with it to look at how the code responded. My work would be on a new link on their webpage, and I was able to create this new space to work with. My colleagues were very helpful when I ran into problems. I was able to ask for help and get them resolved quickly, or just being directed to the right direction for my investigation.

### Early Achievements 
I've found that the early days are very challenging, just getting my feet wet in the code base. It's large and unfamiliar, and hard to find the location of the code in the backend for any visual element on the website. Additionally, the split between the front-end code and the back-end code meant I had to look at two different codebases.

However, I asked my colleagues for help, who had much better knowledge of the code than me to help me get on the right track. I was able to get a great explanation of how the front-end and server-side code were split, as well as how they communicated with each other. They were also able to point me to areas in the code where similar problems had been experienced in the past. This existing code worked great as a reference which allowed me to progress in my task, as they used some methods that I had not known about beforehand to solve the early issues I encountered.

Currently, these early issues are mainly with understanding how JavaScript functions, and the coding conventions that are used within this codebase. I am new to Node.js and Vue, so there is a good amount of convention and syntax still to learn.
