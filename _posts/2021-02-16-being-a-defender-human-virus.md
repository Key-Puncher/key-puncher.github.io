title: Being a Defender - A Human Virus
---

To think like an attacker, is to think about the weakest points of entry. What would I attack first? It's hard not to notice the similarities in a threat like the coronavirus. Our attackers in this case are not people, but a self-spreading virus that nonetheless exploits the vulnerabilities in the system and in people.

A defenders job is in many ways much harder than an attacker's job. To defend, we have to cut of every avenue of spread for the virus. The virus, just has to find a single vector to propagate. This tweet by Victorian Journalist Simon Love shows us just how much work that may be.

Queen Victoria Market underwent a deep clean after a single woman visited it and later tested positive for covid19. As a result, 32 employees and many others who visited the affected area at the time all had to be isolated and tested.

It does bring to mind the difficulties of a defender against a threat. All the security means absolutely nothing in the face of a single leak. If there has been spread, we must find them all. Time will tell if we have, and if the market has been truly secured.
