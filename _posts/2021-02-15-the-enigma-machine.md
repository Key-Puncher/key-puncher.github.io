title: The Enigma Machine
---

An Enigma machine is a famous machine that was believed to be unbreakable. It was used during World War II by the Germans to transmit coded messages. Using a substitution cypher, the machine allows for 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 number of possible encoding combinations for a message. Additionally, the Nazis would change the encoding for messages daily, so that cracking the code for one day would be completely useless the next day.

The machine is made up for many parts, including the keyboard, plugboard, and sets of rotors. The plugboard was a switch board with wires, that can be plugged in to connect two letters into a pair. This indicates a setting where two letters are swapped for each other. The enigma machine takes in three rotors each of which provide different encodings. They can be swapped out and placed in different slots, and the orientation of their letters can change.

For the enigma machine, each time a key was pressed, the entire encoding scheme changes, as rotors move. This means that the message “AA” could be encoded as “BT” even though the same key was used twice.

Because computers were not available, this huge combinatorial code was incredibly difficult for codebreakers to attack.

### Cracking the Enigma

An allied group of code breakers, including Alan Turning, designed the Bombe machine which would crack the code. It was a process of elimination approach that simulated different enigma machine configurations, in a machine that was essentially many enigma machines all testing different settings. The codebreakers looked for phrases that were likely to appear. For example, “Heil Hitler” at the end of the message. Since a letter can never be encoded as itself, the codebreakers would compare to see if a letter in the phrase matched up with a letter in the code. If it does, then the code is not that phrase.

Despite being able to decrypt the German messages, the Allied powers did not act on all information. In order to avoid informing the Nazis that the Enigma had been broken, they acted only on some attacks, and allowed others to go through despite the foreknowledge, so that the Nazis would continue to communicate using the Enigma machine. It was not until the 1970s, 50 years after the war, that the fact that codebreakers had cracked Enigma was declassified.
