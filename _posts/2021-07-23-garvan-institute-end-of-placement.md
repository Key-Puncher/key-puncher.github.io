title: Garvan Institute End of Placement
---

It is now the last day of my work placement with the Garvan Institude. Looking back on my experience here, I recall being intimidated by the code at the beginning, desiring to deliver a good project. I can now say that I have achieved a great result, being able to progress significantly in the code, and completing a majority of the new Covid-19 automated coverage map. 

My supervisor has offered an extension to the contract for me to continue my work on the project.

One thing that I have learnt in working in bioinformatics and science data visualisation, is the difficulty of creating a good graph. It required a lot of tweaking and back and forth discussions on seemingly minor things. However, these tweaks all contributed to the final product being overall cleaner, more intuitive, and easy for people to look at and understand at a glance. The importance in this kind of visual design in presenting data is something I had not considered beforehand.
