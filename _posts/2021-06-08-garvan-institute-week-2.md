title: Garvan Institute Week 2
---

A review of my first week at Garvan, I believe it went quite well. I have made some good progress on the project to visualise the covid-19 proteome. I was able to touch both the frontend and backend server, fetching the required information and rendering it visually in d3. There's still a significant amount of work to do for each of the components. My collegues have been very helpful in guiding me to the things I needed. It's been gratifying to see the pieces of the project start to take shape.

### Situation, Task, Action, Result

It was daunting at first to try to interperate the large amount of code and add to it. I had to break down the task into much smaller, workable sections. I planned out my approach, communicating with my supervisor about key priorities. I subsequently was able to implement and deliver the first aspects of the project, interactive coverage arrows for the proteome.
