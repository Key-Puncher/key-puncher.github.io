title: Garvan Institute Week 2

### Early Experience

My first week at Garvan went quite well. I made some good progress on the project in visualising the covid-19 proteome. I have touched both the front-end and back-end code already, fetching the required information and rendering it visually using D3. There's still a significant amount of work to do for each of the components, but I have been able to make some headway and it's been gratifying to see some pieces of the project rendered on the new webpage. It's only some of the simple early elements, but I'm slowly assembling the other information required. My collegues have been very helpful in guiding me to the things I needed. Things are going a little more smoothly after getting over the initial challenge of finding a starting point. But now I have a lot of things to work on.

### Situation, Task, Action, Result

It was daunting at first to try to interperate the large amount of code and add to it. I had to break down the task into much smaller, workable sections. I planned out my approach, communicating with my supervisor about key priorities. I did a lot of individual research, looking at resources online that could help me achieve the intended result using D3. This included looking at various technology forums, reading documentation, and trying several different methods. This helped me better understand how to approach the task, and also helped me understand the various idiosyncrasies of JavaScript as a programming language. I subsequently was able to implement and deliver the first aspects of the project, the interactive coverage arrows for the proteome.
