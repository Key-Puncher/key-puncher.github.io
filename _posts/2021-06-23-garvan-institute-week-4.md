title: Garvan Institute Week 4

### Half Way Through

It has been approximately a month since starting at garvan. I have made significant progress in the Covid-19 coverage map project. The end of the week will be the mid-session review, and I feel satisfied with the amount of progress I have been able to achieve thus far. So far, I've been able to render arrows that display the sequenced areas of the covid-19 genome (non-dark and dark regions), display the number of matching structures, show the different reading frames and proteins in sequence, and link them all to the detailed protein structures page. 

Though JavaScript was a slight hurdle just familiarising myself with the language and its quirks, I've been able to use the Vue framework and D3 to create a great computer generated version of the coverage map of the covid 19 proteome.

The number of covid cases in Sydney has also been increasing. I hope that this work will be useful to scientists who are studying the virus. It may be necessary for me to look into possibly working from home for a while if infections in Sydney continues to rise. 


### Situation, Task, Action, Result

It was daunting at first to try to interperate the large amount of code and add to it. I had to break down the task into much smaller, workable sections. I planned out my approach, communicating with my supervisor about key priorities. I subsequently was able to implement and deliver the first aspects of the project, interactive coverage arrows for the proteome.
